# Data Exploration Project
Skills: SQL, Joins, CTE, Temp Tables, View

Exploration of COVID-19 fatalities and vaccination statistics sourced from the Our World in Data website through SQL data analysis techniques. Employed various SQL functionalities, including joins, common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and views to conduct in-depth data investigations.

# Data Cleaning Project
Skills: SQL, Self Join, CTE, Update, Alter

-I cleaned the data, employed a self-join to fill missing values, and utilized Common Table Expressions (CTE) with ROW_NUMBER() to eliminate duplicate rows. Additionally, I split a single column into 2-3 individual columns for improved data organization. The resulting dataset is now streamlined, free of duplicates, and structured for more effective analysis.
